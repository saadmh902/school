This README explains all the projects I worked on this semester

I worked on the video games sales data for the most part, I went looking through the differences between shooter and sports sales and any similarity or disparities between the two genres. Averages minimums maximums and any other correlations.

The structuring of the data is very simple

/data/ holds the data process in which we would view the table
/munge/ shows transformations
/src/ shows aggregations
/reports/ shows data visualization

I learned quite a bit this semester!
